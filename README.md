🧑‍💻 GitHub User Finder

A simple web application that fetches and displays user data from the GitHub API based on the username you enter in the search bar.

💡 About the Project

Although using Redux Toolkit for a small project like this might seem a bit “overkill,” I built it for practice purposes — to improve my understanding of state management and scalable component structure.

⚙️ Tech Stack

 * ⚛️ React (Vite) — high-performance frontend setup

 * 🧰 Redux Toolkit — for state management

 * 🍞 React-Toastify — for elegant notifications

 * 💅 CSS Modules — component-level styling

 * 🧩 Highly Componentized Architecture — every feature split into reusable parts

🚀 Features

 * Search any GitHub username and instantly get user data

 * Success and error handling via toast notifications

 * Loading state feedback for better UX

 * Fully modular and reusable component structure

🧠 What I Learned

 * Managing async logic with Redux Toolkit

 * Fetching and handling API responses

 * Improving UX with Toastify

 * Structuring React projects with Vite for performance

🔗 Future Improvements

 * Add light/dark theme toggle

 * Display more detailed GitHub user statistics
